## 🎯 **YOUR CURRENT SITUATION**

**Good News**: Your bot gave a professional, helpful response even without training data.

**The Fix**: With the updated system, your bot will now say:
> "I don't have the current details about our payment methods. Please contact our support team who can provide you with the most up-to-date information and help resolve any checkout issues."

This is **much better** because:
- ✅ It's honest about limitations
- ✅ Directs users to real help
- ✅ Doesn't give potentially wrong technical advice
- ✅ Maintains professional tone

## 📞 **RECOMMENDATION**

**Immediate Action**: Add the payment/checkout FAQ above to your knowledge base.

**Long-term**: Build out the complete FAQ covering all operational aspects of your business.

**Result**: Your chatbot will become a powerful first-line support tool that knows when to help and when to escalate!
